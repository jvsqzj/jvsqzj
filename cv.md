## Experience
### **Intel Corporation** (2019 - present)
#### Server Security Simulation Technical Lead (present)
- Led a team of 3 other engineers by defining requirements, creating documentation, planning, and tracking progress on the readiness of simulation models for various x86 security technologies

- Performed reviews and debugging of low-level firmware to identify issues in the early stages of development

#### Simulator User Experience Developer (2023 - present)
- Got 4 other developers on board to also learn Rust and join this project, and planned features to be implemented by them as contributions to the domain-specific language server

- Implemented a linting module written in Rust which provides a framework to evaluate compliance of code with style and formatting rules established for a domain-specific language used to model devices

- Learned about IDE integration with domain-specific language servers through the Language Server Protocol (LSP) specification from Microsoft

#### Systems Simulation SW Engineer (2021-2023)
- Optimized the simulation of an encryption engine model to reduce runtime of certain workloads with a 60%+ improvement

- Engineered and enhanced a hardware accelerator simulation model for data-center and networking Intel platforms to enable early development and testing of accelerator drivers

- Enabled test automation for simulations of VMware's ESXi operating system through the implementation of an internal Python library to program automated testing steps

- Executed scrum ceremonies in the role of scrum master for a team that developed models for PCI devices

- Interviewed and evaluated candidates in hiring processes

#### Student SW Engineer (2019 - 2021)
- Created a Python application to interact with a REST API to collect and process information from a database for easy feature and bug tracking visualization in Excel (openpyxl)

- Explored low-level extensions of x86 platforms to extract execution traces of assembly code as a PoC for a possible system to gather performance insights on simulation execution

## Skills
